# An end-to-end multilingual framework for intelligent analysis of risk influence factors in ship grounding accidents
With the increasing demand for automation and cross-lingual analysis in maritime safety, analyzing ship grounding accidents presents significant challenges due to single-language data limitations, subjective identification of Risk Influential Factors (RIFs), and the lack of intelligent extraction from unstructured texts. To address these issues, this study develops an end-to-end multilingual intelligent framework that systematically identifies and analyzes key RIFs from ship grounding accident reports. The framework integrates four core technical modules: a web-crawling-based module for constructing a multilingual grounding accident dataset; an objective and accurate RIF ontology developed using Grounded Theory; an intelligent extraction module for multilingual unstructured information based on a fine-tuned Unified Information Extraction Multi-Language (UIE-Multilingual) model; and a sensitivity analysis and case validation module using the constructed TAN-BN model. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the F1 score for information extraction by 7.1\%--12.96\% compared to the optimal baseline model. It also confirms the accuracy of the TAN-BN construction through case studies and produces RIF analysis results consistent with domain expert conclusions. This framework reduces manual effort, enhances analytical accuracy and efficiency, supports intelligent processing of multilingual grounding accident data, and delivers reliable decision-making support for maritime safety management.
